# Command completion for bash shell. Works with any Python script as long as
# it uses Argh as CLI dispatcher. Note that you need to specify the script
# name. It won't work with just some random file.
#
# Put this to your .bashrc.local:
#
#     complete -F _argh_completion PROG
#
# ...where PROG should be your script name (e.g. "manage.py").
